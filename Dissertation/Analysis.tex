\chapter{System Analysis} \label{Chapter:System Analysis}

This chapter will focus on the system analysis. Firstly, it will identify the stakeholders of this system. Then, it will introduce a survey used for identifying significant factors influencing the higher education destination choices in the UK and analyse the survey result to identify user requirements. Eventually, this chapter will present the functional requirements and non-functional requirements of this system.

\section{Stakeholders Identification}

Sommerville \cite{5_sommerville_2011} defined stakeholders are people or organizations who will be affected by the system and who have a direct or indirect influence on the system requirements. Hence, it is necessary to identify stakeholders that are associated with this system. The stakeholders of this system will be international students who want to decide destination universities or cities for their higher education in the UK or other people who want to obtain relevant information on higher education in the UK. They can use this system to search for and view information on different cities and universities to help their decision-making process for higher education in the UK.

\section{Survey Design and Analysis}
In this project, a survey was developed to identify key factors in international students’ decision-making process and analyse the system requirements. This section will firstly introduce the design of the survey and then analyse the results of the survey.
\subsection{Survey Design}

The survey design was based on the analysis in the section 2.1.1. The respondents of the survey were international students who planned to study in the UK for their higher education. In order to carry out this survey, an online questionnaire hosted in iSurvey was used and distributed to the respondents via emails. The online questionnaire consists of two sections and fifteen questions in total. Section 1 would ask respondents some questions about their educational background, while section 2 used a Likert scale, ranging from no influence to strong influence, to gather their opinions on factors influencing their destination choices for higher education. The online questionnaire can be found in Appendix A.

\subsection{Results Analysis}

\textbf{Part 1: Profiles of Respondents}This part will discuss the profiles of 107 respondents in this survey. Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2 show 64.7\% of respondents continued to pursue their master’s degree in the UK after graduating from universities in their home countries. Besides, 5.6\% of respondents obtained their college diplomas, and 3.7\% of respondents obtained their first master’ degrees before studying in the UK. On the other hand, 25.2\% of respondents choose to study in the UK for their bachelors’ degrees after graduating from high schools.\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
Figure 4.3 shows most (83.2\%) of respondents choose to study in universities in England (except Greater London), while respondents who choose to study in Greater London, Wales and Scotland only accounted for 6.5\%, 5.6\% and 4.7\% respectively. The main reason was that England (except Greater London) had more universities and lower living expenses compared with Greater London and closer distance to London compared with Wales and Scotland.

\textbf{Part 2: Perception of the Respondents}This part will focus on the perception of respondents on different factors in their higher education destination choices. The discussion and analysis in this part will provide a great understanding of factors influencing international student’s higher education destination choices in the UK.Table 4.1 provides the overview of the perception of respondents regarding what factors have impacts on their destination choices in the UK. It is evident that cost and environment strongly influenced the respondents’ destination higher education choices, and university ranking was considered as a very influential factor in their destination-making process. By contrast, recommendations, employment rate and entry requirements had moderate influences on the respondents’ destination choices, and the least influential factor was international student population.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
In order to get more details about these key factors, some specific questions were included in the online questionnaire. Table 4.2 presents the perception of respondents about university rankings. Because of the reputations and impacts, Times Higher Education university ranking and QS university ranking were considered to be more influential on respondents’ higher education destination choices, even if all rankings about universities in the UK were regarded as very influential factors concerning university rankings.

Table 4.3 illustrates the perception of respondents regarding different expenses, such as tuition fees, living costs and travel costs. It was evident that travel expenses had fewer impacts on the respondents’ decision-making process for higher education, compared with tuition fees and living costs.

Table 4.4 shows the perception of the respondents on different environmental factors. Information on the safety and location of the city were regarded as two strongly influential factors in the respondents’ decision-making process. Moreover, other information on cities, such as size, location and infrastructure were also considered in their decision making.

Table 4.5 provides the perception of the respondents on recommendations or word-of-mouth. It can be seen that recommendations from agents and official website were more influential than those from the respondents’ parents and friends.

\end{table}


To summarize, the key factors in the international students’ decision-making process for higher education are “university ranking”, “cost” and “environment”. Therefore, information on these three factors should be contained in the system. Specifically, there is no great difference between universities rankings when the international students want to know the reputation of universities as long as these rankings are about universities in the UK. In term of costs, the international students pay much more attention to tuition fees and living expenses, so information on these two types of costs should be provided in this system. Besides, the information on safety and location of cities should also be included in the system to provide information on the environment for international students’ higher education destination choices in the UK.

\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}

Apart from functional requirements, the non-functional requirements should be taken into consideration during the design and implementation stages. Table 4.8 displays the non-functional requirements that should be complied with to build a high-quality system.

\section{Summary}
This chapter provides information on the system analysis. It consists of the stakeholders of this system, the user requirements, the system requirements (functional and non-functional requirements). Besides, the survey designed for identifying key factors in international students’ decision-making process is introduced and analysed to determine the user requirements of this system.
