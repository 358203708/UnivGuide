\begin{abstract}
With the contemporary globalisation, the number of international students in the UK has risen strongly over the last decade. When international students choose universities and cities for their higher education, they will take many different factors into consideration. Therefore, international studentsâ€™ higher education destination choice involves multiple factors. Some of these factors play a vital role in this decision-making process. There are many potential benefits of open data for higher education, and one of them is to help students make informed education decisions.  Data visualisation is a powerful tool to represent and analyse the data, so it becomes essential for decision making. 

This dissertation identified some significant factors that influence the decision-making process of international students in the UK for their higher education and implemented a web application to visualise open data about these factors. This web-based application proved to be helpful for international students when they decide destination cities and universities for their higher education in the UK.\end{abstract}
